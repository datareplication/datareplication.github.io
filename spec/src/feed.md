  - must not contain loops
  - links must be consistent
    - page1: next=page2
    - page2: prev=page1
- entry point: URL to a feed page
  - SHOULD be latest page
  - others are possible
- required header for every page:
  - Last-Modified
  - Link rel=self ???
  - if previous page: Link rel=prev
  - if next page: Link rel=next
- required header for every entity:
  - Last-Modified
  - Operation-Type (PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
  - Content-ID
    - strictly required?
- MUST support GET and HEAD requests
- Last-Modified MUST be monotonically increasing across all pages
- Last-Modified of a page MUST be the Last-Modified of its last entity
  - softer: >= Last-Modified of its last entity, <= Last-Modified of the first entity on the next page, >= Last-Modified of the previous page
- Content-IDs MUST be unique within a feed
- pages MUST be immutable
  - exceptions:
    - removing prev link from an old page to incrementally GC old things
